## Why do I need both `Eslint` and `Prettier`?

`Eslint` is a language linter and `Prettier` is a formatter. They are having some intersections but not duplicated.

## How can I make them work together?

First of all, you need to install these 3 packages

* eslint
* prettier
* [prettier-eslint](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint)
